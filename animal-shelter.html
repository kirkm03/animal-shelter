    <h1>Imaginationland Animal Shelter</h1>
    <p><strong>Thank you for visiting our shelter!</strong> Even in a land of whimsy and dreams,
      animals sometimes lose their way and have nowhere to go. Our shelter has
      proudly provided these creatures with a temporary home until they can find
      their forever home. Maybe that will be with you!</p>
    <p>Please take the time to read about several of our featured adoptable pets.
      If you're interested in adopting one, stop by our shelter, located at the
      rift between the <span class="Good">Good</span> and <span class="Evil">Evil</span>
       realms of Imaginationland, to meet them in person.</p>

      <img src="img/squirrely.png" alt="An adorable talking Squirrel.">
      <p>Small in stature, with a big round head, and short little arms, Squirrely
        has light, taupe-colored fur, with spots of pale green on his belly, under
        his tail, and right above his dark red eyes. Around his neck, Squirrely
        wears a bright red scarf. He speaks in a soft, welcoming voice that is
        incredibly misleading. He also bears a strong southern accent.</p>

    <div class="note">
      <p>Please note that these animals are very fond of each other, and would prefer
      to be adopted together if possible. Something about blood orgies...anyways
      aren't they so cute?!</p>
